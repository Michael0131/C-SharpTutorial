# C# Fundamentals Tutorial

Welcome to the C# Fundamentals Tutorial. Every beginning C# programmer should understand these basic topics:


- [Stacks](./1-stack.md)
- [Lists](./2-lists.md)
- [Trees](./3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
